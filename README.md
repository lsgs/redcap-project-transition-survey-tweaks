## Summary

Uses survey pre-filling to capture data entered about project, title, purpose etc. in surveys used when creating/requesting a new project, copying a project, or changing the status of a project.

********************************************************************************
## Configuration

* Enable this module for all projects if you want to use the functionaity for copying a project or changing a project's status (not just create/request project).
* No further configuration is required other than entering the survey project ids you wish to use on the Control Center > User Settings page.

[Optional]
* System-level setting to have transition surveys presented to superusers. REDCap's built-in behaviour is to not show surveys to superusers.
